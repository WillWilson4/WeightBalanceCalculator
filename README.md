# Weight and Balance Aviation Calculator

## Overview
This MATLAB project calculates the weight, balance, and center of gravity (CoG) for a 1965 Piper Cherokee PA-28-180 aircraft. It ensures the plane operates within safe weight and balance conditions, helping pilots confirm flight readiness.

## Features
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures accurate entry of weights and fuel levels.
- **Center of Gravity Calculation**: Computes the CoG based on input variables.
- **Flight Safety Determination**: Outputs whether the aircraft is safe to fly based on weight and balance.

## Usage
1. Run the script `Project1Problem1.m`.
2. Follow the prompts to enter:
   - Weight of the pilot and co-pilot.
   - Weight of passengers.
   - Fuel level in gallons.
3. The program calculates the CoG and determines whether the aircraft meets safety criteria.

## Files
- **userweightvars.m**: Function to collect and validate user inputs for weights.
- **Project1Problem1.m**: Main script to calculate the weight and balance.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021b or later.
